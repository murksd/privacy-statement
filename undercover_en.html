<h2>Processing of Personal Data</h2>
<p>
This app itself does not collect or store any personal data.
Game progress and settings are stored locally on the user's device only.

<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>
This app uses so-called <strong>rewarded video ads</strong> provided by
Google AdMob (Google Ireland Limited).

Watching these ads is <strong>voluntary</strong> and allows users to unlock
certain additional features or benefits within the app.
Once a rewarded video ad has started, it <strong>cannot be skipped or interrupted</strong>.

<p>
During ad delivery, personal data such as device information or advertising IDs
may be processed. This processing is carried out in accordance with Google's
privacy policies.
